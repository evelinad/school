Assignment 3

Task1
	In the Map stage I emit a Key-Value pair with the year of the song and
the loudness. IN the Reduce stage I compute the average of the loudness for each
year. The data types for the key-value pairs are LongWritable and FloatWritable.
I believe that the spikes from the left side of the graph are due to the way the
songs were recorded (i.e: the type of the musical disks: vinyl disks, CD/DVD,
computer disk support). On the early years, the type of disks was low quality.


Task2
	I defined the MusicalNotes data type for storing the values (the
minor/major tempo/loudness and the number of samples) from the key-value pairs
of the Map/Reduce stages. In the Map stage I emit key-value pair corresponding to
the year of the songs and a MusicalNotes data type for storing the
tempo/loudness and the mode for a specific song. In the Reduce stage I compute
the average for each year and mode type.
	It does not seem to be any correspondance between minor/major modes and
loudness and tempo levels.

Task3
	The value type of the key-value pairs is a custom one for storing the
loduness/tempo and the number of samples (similar to task2, but without any
difference for the mode). I defined a new key type (MusicGenreKey) for storing
the genre of the song.
	In the Map stage I detect  the genre of the song by using the
detectGenre method from the GenreDetector class. In the Reduce stage I compute
the average of the loudness/tempo for each genre type. When the hadoop job
finishes, I sort the result  based on nr songs/loudness/tempo.

Task4
	The key type used is the same as in task 3. For the values, I
defined the Importance data type that stores the influence score of every genre
for a specific song. In the map stage I emit a key-value pair of every known
genre and the Importance scores of a specific song. In the Reduce stage I sum up
the Importance scores for every genre and transform it to percentage (the
fraction between the score of the genre-key and the scores of the other genres;
all the time the fraction is computed as smaller value/bigger value).
The importance score of a Genre for a song is computed based on the matching
between the genre keywords and terms that describe the song. For each match it
is added the term frequency of the term from the song
(see computeImportance from GenreDetector).
